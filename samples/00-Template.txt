TUTORIAL "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AST3RA-x9oA"
COMMENT "Lennon composed 'Imagine' one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.

Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C.

With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a time signature of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 beats per minute."

# Chord: $Name $Tablature $Fingering $Comment
# You can use # and b in chord names, will be displayed as nice sharp resp. flat symbols.
# Although not recommended, spaces are allowed in chord names.
# You then have to use quotes, also when using this chord in a bar (quote whole bar).
# $Fingering and $Comment are optional.
# $Tablature must contain 6 characters (one per string).
# Each character can either be 0 (open string) or a fret number or "x" (mute).
# Frets starting from 10 are given by a capital letter: A = 10, B = 11, ..., Z = 35.
# $Fingering must contain 6 or 8 characters: either 0 (no finger) or T,1,2,3,4.
# These 6 characters can be followed by a "/f" where f is the number of the barred fret.
# "/-" means there is no barred fret and is the same as not specifying it at all.

# When multiple chords exists for the same name, the last one is actually used.
# Below, we have an alternate version for 2 chords: uncomment to use them.
